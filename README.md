The "IIITD_Mess" Android project consists of two portals: the student portal and the admin portal.</br></br></br>
The student portal enables IIITD students to conveniently purchase mess coupons for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner on a monthly basis.</br>
It provides students with access to the daily menu and facilitates coupon purchases using QR code scanning and UPI payment integration.</br></br>

The admin portal empowers administrators to set the menu for each day and efficiently manage student records.</br>
Admins have the ability to view and manipulate student data as needed.</br></br>

Additionally, the IIITD_Mess app offers a feature that tracks the occupancy of the mess, which comprises the first and second floors. The app utilizes Access Points to determine the number of clients associated with each floor, enabling it to assess the presence of users in the mess. The app also analyzes the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to verify if users are located inside the mess or associated with the access points but potentially situated on the ground floor.
